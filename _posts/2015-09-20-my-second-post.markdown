Now this is my second post far from my first one. Nothing to say, but till now I know that the jeklly has its new version. I update it to the latest version on my Macbook. I got a problem when I ran command of 'jekyll server --watch', no server was started. I searched the problem on google and I find it that in the latest version of Jekyll, 'jekyll server' will be started with the 'watch' mode. And if no server is started, we may try to use a option '--force_polling'.
